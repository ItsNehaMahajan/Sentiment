 Sentiment Analysis of News

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of news articles, aiming to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the news content. Sentiment analysis can provide valuable insights into public opinion and can be utilized in various domains such as finance, politics, and marketing.

 Overview

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and extract subjective information from text data. In the context of news articles, sentiment analysis can help in understanding the overall sentiment expressed towards specific topics, events, or entities.

 Features

- Text Preprocessing: The text data from news articles is preprocessed to remove noise, such as punctuation, stop words, and special characters.
- Sentiment Classification: Utilizing machine learning or deep learning models to classify the sentiment of news articles into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
- Visualization: Visualizing the sentiment analysis results through graphs or charts to provide a clear understanding of sentiment trends over time or across different topics.
- Integration: Ability to integrate sentiment analysis into existing news platforms or applications for real-time sentiment monitoring.

 Technologies Used

- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries (NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob)
- Machine Learning Libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Web Scraping (Beautiful Soup, Scrapy)
- Data Visualization Libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
